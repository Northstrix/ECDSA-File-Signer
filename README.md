# ECDSA File Signer

A simple app that enables you to sign the files and verify their integrity/authenticity using the ECDSA and SHA-512.

I originally developed this app for my university course, but I also decided to post it on GitHub on Sourceforge.
This application is made for educational purposes only. Despite having well-functioning cryptographic features, it may not be reliable.
This application is provided with no warranty or guarantees of any kind. Use it at your own risk!
Made with the help of the ChatGPT and Perplexity.

This project also has a page on SourceForge https://sourceforge.net/projects/ecdsa-file-signer/
